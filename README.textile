h1. Resque::Failure::CrashLog

Use the @crashlog@ gem as you normally would - and just add the following failure backend to your Resque setup. Here's my current setup:

<pre><code>require 'resque/failure/multiple'
require 'resque-crashlog'

Resque::Failure::Multiple.classes = [
  Resque::Failure::Redis, Resque::Failure::CrashLog
]
Resque::Failure.backend = Resque::Failure::Multiple</code></pre>

h2. Contributing

There's really so little code involved here, so I've not bothered with tests. Don't tell anyone. If you want to add them - or contribute in other ways - please fork and offer patches in separate branches.
